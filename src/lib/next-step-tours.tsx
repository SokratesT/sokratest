            A response usually includes references to course material that the
            Tutoring System considered particularly relevant. Since these
            references are automatically retrieved, please note that not all
            referenced material is necessarily relevant. For technical reasons,
            these references furthermore do not yet adhere to common citation
            standards. The system may cite some sources in verbatim without
            indicating so in the text. In any case, if the system references
            material, it has definitely also used that material to generate the
            response.
