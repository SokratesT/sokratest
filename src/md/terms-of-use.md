### 1. Introduction and Your Agreement

Welcome to Sokrates<sup>t</sup> (the "Platform"). This educational platform is provided by Rhine-Waal University, located at Friedrich-Heinrich-Allee 25, 47475 Kamp-Lintfort, Germany ("Rhine-Waal University", "We", "Us", "Our"). These Terms of Use ("Terms") explain the rules for using Sokrates<sup>t</sup>.

You also agree to our **Sokrates<sup>t</sup> Privacy Policy**, which explains how we handle your data and is a part of this agreement.

### 2. Who Can Use Sokrates<sup>t</sup> (Eligibility)

### 3. What Sokrates<sup>t</sup> Offers

Sokrates<sup>t</sup> allows you to chat with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help you learn. The AI uses materials uploaded by your instructor (like documents and presentations) to try and give relevant answers. Using Sokrates<sup>t</sup> should help you learn and also helps us research and improve educational AI tools.

### 4. Important Disclaimer: AI Can Make Mistakes (Hallucinations)

*   **Be Aware:** The AI in Sokrates<sup>t</sup>, like many AI systems, can sometimes provide information that is incorrect, incomplete, misleading, or entirely made up. These errors are sometimes called "hallucinations."
*   **Educational Tool Only:** The AI chat is meant for exploring ideas and stimulating discussion, **not** as a source of guaranteed factual information or expert advice.
*   **Verify Information:** **Do not rely solely on the AI's answers** for assignments, exams, or important decisions. Always double-check information from the AI against your official course materials, reliable academic sources, or by asking your instructor.
*   **No Liability for Errors:** Rhine-Waal University is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the AI's responses. You are responsible for how you use the information provided by the AI. Using incorrect information from the AI in your academic work will not be excused based on these Terms.

### 5. How You Should Use Sokrates<sup>t</sup> (Permitted Use)

Please use Sokrates<sup>t</sup> only for its intended educational purposes:

*   Chat with the AI to explore and understand your course material.
*   Provide feedback through the platform to help us improve it.
*   Use the platform responsibly and in line with Rhine-Waal University's academic rules.

### 6. What You Cannot Do on Sokrates<sup>t</sup> (Prohibited Conduct)

To keep Sokrates<sup>t</sup> safe and functional, you agree **not** to do any of the following:

*   Use the platform for anything illegal, fraudulent, or harmful.
*   Try to hack, disable, or interfere with the platform's security or the AI's safety features (like trying to "jailbreak" the AI).
*   Upload viruses or other harmful software.
*   Post or input anything that is abusive, harassing, offensive, hateful, or discriminatory.
*   Use the platform to violate copyrights or other intellectual property rights (don't paste large amounts of copyrighted text unless provided by your instructor or allowed).

*   Pretend to be someone else.
*   Use automated tools (like bots or scrapers) to access or overload the platform.
*   Use the platform for any commercial purpose.
*   Do anything that could disrupt or harm the platform, its servers, or other users.

Breaking these rules could lead to your access being suspended or terminated.

### 7. Ownership and Content Rights

*   **The Platform:** Rhine-Waal University owns the Sokrates<sup>t</sup> platform itself (the software, design, etc.). These Terms give you permission to use it, but not ownership.
*   **Course Materials:** Materials uploaded by your instructor belong to them or their respective owners. Use them according to course rules.
*   **Your Questions (Input):** You own the questions you type into the chat. However, you give us permission to use your questions to operate and improve Sokrates<sup>t</sup> and for our research (your data will be anonymised if used in publications, as stated in the Privacy Policy).
*   **AI Answers (Output):** The text generated by the AI is for your educational use related to your studies. You don't own the AI's answers. You can use them for personal study, but remember the accuracy disclaimer (Section 4). Don't share large amounts of AI answers publicly without checking the information.
*   **Your Feedback:** If you give us feedback about Sokrates<sup>t</sup>, thank you! We can use your feedback freely to improve the platform or for research, without paying you or giving you credit. In turn, you can use Sokrates<sup>t</sup> completely free of charge - win-win!

### 8. Service Limitations and Disclaimers ("As Is")

Sokrates<sup>t</sup> is a work in progress, especially during this testing phase. We provide it **"as is"** and **"as available"**.

*   **No Guarantees:** We don't promise that Sokrates<sup>t</sup> will always meet your needs, be available without interruption, or be completely free of errors or bugs.
*   **Accuracy Not Guaranteed:** We do not guarantee that any information or AI output from the platform will be accurate or reliable (please remember Section 4).
*   **Data Loss Risk:** Because this is a testing phase, regular backups are not guaranteed. There's a possibility your chat history or other data could be lost. While we are working hard on mitigating this and minimising "resetting" the system, we are not liable for any data loss.

### 9. Our Responsibility is Limited (Limitation of Liability)

To the maximum extent permitted by German law, Rhine-Waal University or the Sokrates<sup>t</sup> project team (including its staff and partners) will not be legally responsible for any indirect damages or losses (like loss of data, profit, or goodwill) resulting from your use or inability to use Sokrates<sup>t</sup>. This includes damages caused by:

*   Your use of (or inability to use) the platform.
*   Content or conduct of others on the platform.
*   Your reliance on any information or AI output from the platform (remember Section 4).
*   Someone accessing your account without permission.
*   Any other issues related to the platform.

This limitation applies regardless of the legal basis of the claim (contract, negligence, etc.), even if we were warned such damages might occur. Our liability for direct damages will also be limited as far as German law allows. (Note: This does not limit liability for harm caused intentionally or through gross negligence, as required by German law).

### 10. Ending Your Access (Termination)

*   **By Us:** We can suspend or stop your access to Sokrates<sup>t</sup> at any time, for reasons such as:

*   **What Happens:** If your access ends, you won't be able to use Sokrates<sup>t</sup> anymore. Your data will be handled as described in our Privacy Policy. Some sections of these Terms (like 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12) will still apply even after termination.

### 11. Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of Germany. Any legal disputes related to these Terms will be handled by the competent courts in or responsible for Kamp-Lintfort or Kleve, Germany.

### 12. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms sometimes. If we make important changes, we will notify you on the platform (like with a pop-up when you log in) before the changes take effect. The notice will explain the changes. To continue using Sokrates<sup>t</sup> after the changes, you will need to agree to the new Terms. If you don't agree, you should stop using the platform and ask to have your account deleted (see Section 10).
